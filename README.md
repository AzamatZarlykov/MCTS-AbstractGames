# MCTS on Abstract Games

This is the program that implements and tests the Monte-Carlo Tree Search<br>
algorithm implementation on games that implement general-purpose interface<br>
In this project, there are only 2 games written to test the algorithm: <br>[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/medovina/ai_1/blob/master/src/minimax/tictactoe) and [Trivial game](https://github.com/medovina/ai_1/tree/master/src/minimax/trivial)

The performance of the MCTS is assessed against the specific strategies for the <br> 
specific game. 
* [Basic strategy](https://github.com/medovina/ai_1/blob/master/src/minimax/tictactoe/BasicStrategy.java) (TicTacToe)
* [Perfect strategy](https://github.com/medovina/ai_1/blob/master/src/minimax/trivial/TrivialGame.java) (Trivial)
